# Easy CSV Analysis

## About the Project

The purpose of this project was to apply learned PHP knowledge and prior HTML/JS skill to create a simple webpage that allows users to upload csv's and returns a table with averages and other statistical summaries of each column in the csv. The idea was to create a tool to summarize CSVs for users without them having to look at the CSV itself, giving them a snapshot of their data as well as the general distributions of all the variables in the data. 

This project was a starting point for the concept of automatic CSV analysis; If this idea were to go forward, further data analysis would be done leaning on Javascript instead of PHP. This would include analyzing the data for any notable trends and associations between variables and using a charting library (eg., D3.js) to create a visual summary report. However, these features were not developed in order to keep the focus on PHP learnings from lecture, with the express hope being to achieve the project's objective of applying PHP knowledge.

Other features that would improve the usefulness of this project include:

* Added support for more complex data analysis tasks, such as performing statistical tests or running predictive machine algorithms to allow the user to create projections
* Allowing users to select which columns to analyze or which analysis tasks to perform
* Implementing real-time updates, so that the visualization automatically updates as the user uploads new CSV files or changes the analysis parameters
* Adding security measures to prevent malicious CSV files from executing arbitrary code on the server-side.
